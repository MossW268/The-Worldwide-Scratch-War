<h1><a name="_w3tndhbsyre4"></a>Episode 1 - Fear</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>After Scratch Cat tells everyone that Kaj has returned,
everyone fears that he will wreak as much havoc as last time. Nammy suggests
the idea of a duplicator machine to make battling him easier.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>SCENE 1</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: (on phone) Okay, I'll be able to finish the GUI soon,
Nambase, bye!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS puts down the phone. Soon, he hears plane noises and
opens his massive window to see what is happening. Geo is in a plane, looking
out a medium open window.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS (struggling to speak because of the wind): Why are you
in a plane outside my window, Geo?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GEO: I came so we could talk about the flight show we were
putting on together!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS sighs as GEO says the word “together”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS (unconvincingly lying): Oh, sorry but, um, I have an
appointment with the, um, Scratch Council in 5 minutes, so, um, I’ll have to do
it later!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GEO: Okay, I guess I just won’t do it then!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS drops a pencil in embarrassment as he doesn’t want to
ruin GEO’s flight show.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: Okay, okay, I don’t actually have an appointment with the
Scratch Council, I just wanted to get out of doing the meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GEO: I could tell, you aren’t a very convincing liar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The plane flies closer to the window, and GEO opens the door
and jumps in through MOSS’s window.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GEO: So, I’ve arranged with Hydro Tech to use their planes
and…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On MOSS’s speaker there is a critical error sound, and the
ANNOUNCER begins to talk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ANNOUNCER: All members of the Scratch Council, please report
to the meeting room immediately!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: I guess I <b>am</b> going to the Scratch Council after
all!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS and GEO run through the door, the camera moves through
a wall and MOSS and GEO are running down stairs, the camera moves again and
they are in a corridor, walking to the door of the Scratch Council Room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>SCENE 2</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Scratch council is shaped like a horse-shoe, with the
door in the opening. At the far end is SCRATCH CAT, who is older, and the
Scratch Security Council, previously known as the Scratch Team, sits around
SCRATCH CAT. The rest of the Scratch Council sits in the remaining spaces.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS and GEO get to their positions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>SCRATCH CAT (voice magnified as he is speaking into a
microphone): Quite recently, I have been informed that KAJ has escaped from our
top-security Scratch Prison 15 miles from here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The crowd start muttering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>SCRATCH CAT: If you have the chance, try and search for him,
we do not want a repeat of the destruction he caused 20 years ago. If you have
any suggestions…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NAMMY (interrupting): I have a suggestion, Scratch Cat!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>SCRATCH CAT: Okay, but I’m sure it can wait until the…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NAMMY: I’m going to try creating a duplication machine, so
we can be in two places at once!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>SCRATCH CAT: As amazing as your idea sounds, Nambaseking01,
the complications it could cause are…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NAMMY: Never tell me the odds!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>SCRATCH CAT: I wasn’t telling you the odds, I was telling
you that the servers may overload if everyone duplicated themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NAMMY: I don’t want everyone to use it, only the people who
want to fight Kaj!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>SCRATCH CAT: Okay then, go ahead! But if you start giving it
out to everyone, then I will have to…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NAMMY: I already told you, I wasn’t planning on doing that!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>SCENE 3</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometime later, the Scratch Council are walking out of the
hall. MOSS and GEO are at the front. NAMMY is behind them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: So basically, KAJ is back?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GEO: That’s what he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: We don’t have any way to fight him, last time he
nearly overpowered SCRATCH CAT.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GEO: Actually we do, because if you didn’t notice, NAMMY is
going to make a duplicator machine…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: And that’s the worst idea I’ve ever heard, I thought
Nambase was better at thinking of ideas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NAMMY: Saying something?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: Oh, I didn’t mean it, I…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NAMMY: I forgive you, I didn’t have a lot of time to think
it through. But then it holds a lot of promise, maybe you could see me in my
lab in a couple days?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: Okay!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NAMMY goes into a door on the left, HYDRO is talking with
someone on the other side, when GEO sees him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GEO: Hydro, so we have all the dates sorted?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>HYDRO: Yes, you don’t need to keep asking me about it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GEO: I was just making sure you knew.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GEO turns a corner while MOSS and HYDRO keep going.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>HYDRO: It’s kind of annoying, really, I think it will be a
huge waste of time, no-one else seems to care about flight shows except GEO.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: I know, but we’ve made it seem like everyone likes it,
and we’re the weird ones. Also, do you know anything else about KAJ? All I know
is that he tried to take over Scratch and got banned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>HYDRO: No, I don’t, but there probably is more to it than
that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>SCENE 4</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a periscope moving above the ground, the camera
goes into it and comes out with BLACKHEART looking through it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BLACKHEART: Nothing interesting here, KAJ. Just empty
fields.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>KAJ: Well make sure we can get to Scratch soon. I have not
seen it since the Scratch Team forced me out all those years ago. Why did they
do that? Surely they would surrender, only their own building wasn’t occupied
by my forces.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BLACKHEART: Because they wanted glory, to be the ones who
vanquished KAJ, SCRATCH CAT and the Scratch Mentors all failed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>KAJ: I still don’t feel like you are telling me all you
know. Haven’t you realized that all of our plans need precise information to
proceed?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BLACKHEART: I’m telling you all I know, Kaj. You know how
much I want you in power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>KAJ: And yet you haven’t told me why you want me in power?
You are not a loyal servant, Blackheart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BLACKHEART: No, please… Would you still let me serve you if
I did something useful?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>KAJ: Like what?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BLACKHEART: I’ll find something so we can get to Scratch. I
know a… hack that could give us control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>SCENE 4</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>Music – Examining the Duplicator Machine</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In NAMMY’s laboratory, he is typing Proli code on a computer
connected to a cylinder machine with a rectangular hole through the middle. He
hears the door open, the camera moves and MOSS is walking down the stairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: How is the machine going so far?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NAMMY: Fine, I have created the base machine, I will have to
make a booth to stand in though, and I am currently inserting the code into the
machine so it knows what to do. The code is a bit hard to do though, when will
you finish the GUI?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: Soon, but it seems pointless if you can do all this
without it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NAMMY: I can do it, but it’s hard. I’ll go to SCRATCH CAT
soon so I can get it hooked up to the Worldwide Co-Ordinate Tracking System and
the Universal Blockbase, otherwise the Duplicating part won’t work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: The Universal Blockbase? Are you sure SCRATCH CAT will
let you in there? It could be dangerous if it was mis-used.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NAMMY: But I’m not planning on using it wrongly, am I?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: I know. I’ll see you tomorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS leaves through the left door where he came in, 2
seconds later NAMMY leaves through the right door. The camera moves down, and
sparks fly out of the machine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>VOICE: Congratulations, this device is now connected to the
Universal Blockbase, have a nice day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The computer turns red, and more sparks fly out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BLACKHEART (voice slightly corrupted): I have found a
machine with the purpose to duplicate, master. Should we get to work?</p>

<h1><a name="_nltfqkn2izte"></a>Episode 2 - The Duplicator</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Nammy presents his duplicator machine to the Scratchers,
but he soon realizes that some extra programming has been added to it.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>RECAP</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ANNOUNCER: All members of the Scratch Council, please report
to the meeting room immediately!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>SCRATCH CAT: KAJ has escaped from our top-security Scratch
Prison 15 miles from here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NAMMY: I’m going to try creating a duplication machine, so

<p class=MsoNormal><b>SCENE 1</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moss is looking around Scratch HQ. He walks to someone who
is painting a wall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: Er, excuse me?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The person doesn’t respond.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: Hello?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The person notices him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PAINTER: What do you want, I’m trying to paint here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He shows him a picture of GEO.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: Have you seen GEO anywhere? Y’know, official name’s
TheFlightShow, wears a t-shirt with a plane on it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PAINTER: Never heard of ‘em.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS sighs. He walks back to his room in disappointment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>SCENE 2</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS is on a video call with HYDRO</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>HYDRO: That’s really strange, MOSS. I hope that nothing bad
happened to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: But it seems like that did happen, because people
don’t normally disappear randomly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>HYDRO: Hold on..</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: What?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>HYDRO: I think I know why GEO randomly disappeared! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: Why?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>HYDRO: Do you remember that flight show they were putting
on?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: Uh... yeah?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>HYDRO: I was… the only person who attended.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: WHAT??</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>HYDRO: Well, <i>you</i> were supposed to be there!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: I had… other things on my mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>HYDRO: Like what?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MOSS: I mean… this whole Kaj business. I honestly don’t know
what to believe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>HYDRO: But Scratch Cat was the
one who told everyone! If you can’t trust Scratch Cat, you can’t trust anyone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>MOSS: I know, but how did Scratch
Cat get the information?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>HYDRO: He’s the mascot of
Scratch. He probably has his sources.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>MOSS: Oh my goodness!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>HYDRO: What?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>MOSS: I just remembered
something!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>HYDRO: What did you remember?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>MOSS: The duplicator machine
showcase is happening today!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>HYDRO: Oh, yeah. It’s in the
evening though.</p>

now though.</p>
